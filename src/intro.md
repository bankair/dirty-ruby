Before working with ruby, at the beginning of 2014, I spent ten years working
as a software contractor (C#/C++) for several quite big clients (mostly banks).

During that time, the most difficult part of the job was finding docs and
helpful third party softwares. You can imagine my amazement when I started
to work with ruby, its gems, and its ocean of helpful documentations.

The only thing I lacked at that time was some kind of collection of design
best practices and tips. That's why I'm trying to collect what I discovered
and tested (on the field) on this subject.

I hope it will help you as it helped me.
