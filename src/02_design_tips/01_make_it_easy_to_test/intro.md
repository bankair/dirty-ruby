TDD is quite a dividing subject. Some say it's dead, and others that it's
the way to successful software crafting.

However, something that everybody agree upon is that a project with no tests
is meant to die painfully.

In this section, we'll cover several subjects:

1. How to identify and segment responsibility in your design.
1. How to design your ruby code to be easily testable (because easily tested
code is less likely to contain bugs).
1. How to cope with a code base that has no or poor tests.
